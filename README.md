# 👋 Hey there! I'm Alisha. You can call me Seraphina

Welcome to my GitHub corner! 🌐

## About Me

I'm a passionate **cybersecurity student** with a deep love for **cryptography** and the **offensive side** of security. When I'm not diving into code, you can find me exploring the depths of **Linux**, tweaking configs, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm.

## What I Love
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity**: Breaking, fixing, and securing systems.
- 🔐 **Cryptography**: The art of keeping secrets safe.
- 🖥️ **Linux**: My go-to playground for all things tech.
- 🎮 **Offensive Security**: Red teaming, ethical hacking, and pushing the limits.

## Let's Connect!
- 💬 Always up for a chat about cybersecurity, Linux, or the latest in cryptography.
- 🔍 Exploring new challenges and contributing to open-source projects.
